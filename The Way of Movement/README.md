## Description

The Way of Movement was designed to be a place where people interested in increasing their physical movement abilities, learning new styles and approaches to fitness and exercise, and gaining a better understanding and self awareness of their bodies and minds. It's a place where they can learn these things and more through the forms of reading posts, watching videos, and have lessons if they wish.

Movement is an inescapable, unstoppable force. No matter how you may try to stop moving, you're alway moving, so why not gain a better understanding of your physical nature? why not practice multiple containers of physicality? So often nowadays people only practice one, maybe two things with their bodies with any intention. Whilst their is a plethora of forms which their physical expressions may take form. You may have a bucket load, even a truck load of reasons why not to (no time, no space, no money, don't know how, etc. etc.), most of these reasons are merely excuses, all made up.

The Way of Movement is a place where you can begin learning more about your physical nature and what it means to be a human. I'll leave you with some questions: Are you a human or an animal? Where do you exist within the dimensions of physicality? are you merely a brain with a meat sack or were you formed to be something more?
